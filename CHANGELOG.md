## [1.1.0] - 2026-01-22

### Added

- Event de-duplication fields: `event_id` and optional `dedupe_key` on all webhook requests
- Identity collection: iOS IDFV, Android GAID/App Set ID (+ optional Android ID fallback)
- Session tracking with `session` events and session identifiers
- User properties (whitelisted/blacklisted) persisted in PlayerPrefs and attached to all requests
- Public `AudiencelabSDK.SendCustomEvent` API for custom events
- Identity settle window (2s) for creative token fetching and session start events when GAID is enabled
- Optional Debug Overlay (Editor/Development only) for request status and recent events
- Token fetch retry loop with exponential backoff (max 10 retries, 5 minute cap)
- Webhook event queue with file persistence for offline or missing-token scenarios
- Automatic queue flush when token becomes available or connectivity is restored
- `AudiencelabSDK.SendAdEvent()` and `AudiencelabSDK.SendPurchaseEvent()` convenience methods
- Reserved property keys (starting with `_`) for backend-only use; developers cannot set or unset these
- Enhanced debug overlay with token status, last fetch attempt time, and request envelope snapshot
- Connectivity monitoring to reset retry counts and flush queued events when back online

### Changed

- Fetch-token request now includes identity and user properties
- Token response can return whitelisted properties which are merged locally
- `retention_day` sent as `int?` instead of string in webhook payloads
- Editor settings UI reorganized into tabs (Main, Privacy, Debug)
- Deprecated direct `AdMetrics` and `PurchaseMetrics` method calls in favor of `AudiencelabSDK` methods

### Fixed

- Fixed iOS build errors caused by `DllImport` declarations incorrectly placed inside method bodies
- Fixed Android/iOS native code attempting to compile in Editor by adding `!UNITY_EDITOR` guards
- Removed unused Unity Ads and Unity Purchasing assembly references that could cause build issues

## [1.0.1] - 2025-08-25

### Added

- Added optional `tr_id` (transaction ID) field to purchase events for better transaction tracking and deduplication
- The `tr_id` field is now available in both `SendCustomPurchaseEvent` and `SendPurchaseEvent` methods

### Fixed

- Fixed floating-point precision errors in cumulative value tracking for both purchase and ad events
- Changed storage mechanism from PlayerPrefs.SetFloat/GetFloat to PlayerPrefs.SetString/GetString to maintain full double precision
- This resolves issues where cumulative values were accumulating rounding errors over multiple events
- Both `total_purchase_value` and `total_ad_value` now maintain accurate precision across all events
- Only cumulate total purchase value when the status is completed or success
- Enhanced number parsing and formatting with culture-invariant culture and robust number styles for international compatibility

## [1.0.0] - 2025-08-XX

### Added

- Introduced cumulative `total_purchase_value` tracking for purchase events. The SDK now maintains a persistent, device-local sum of all purchase values (revenue) generated by the user.
- Every purchase event now automatically includes a `total_purchase_value` field, representing the total value of all purchases made by the user since app install.
- The cumulative value is stored using Unity's PlayerPrefs and persists across app sessions and device restarts.
- Updated `SendCustomPurchaseEvent` and new `SendPurchaseEvent` APIs to automatically update and include `total_purchase_value` in event payloads.
- Added `AudiencelabSDK.GetTotalPurchaseValue()` to retrieve the current cumulative purchase value for the user.
- Updated documentation and usage examples to reflect the new purchase API and event data structure.
- Added SDK version tracking to all web requests. Every request now includes `sdk_version` and `sdk_type` fields for better analytics and debugging.
- Created centralized `SDKVersion` class to manage SDK version information across the entire SDK.
- All webhook requests and device metrics requests now include SDK version information in their payloads.
- Added dynamic app version tracking using Unity's `Application.version` and `Application.bundleVersion`.
- All web requests now include `app_version` and `app_bundle_version` fields for comprehensive version tracking.
- Added public methods `GetAppVersion()`, `GetAppBundleVersion()`, `GetSDKVersion()`, and `GetUnityVersion()` for easy access to version information.

## [0.9.9] - 2025-07-22

### Added

- Introduced cumulative `total_ad_value` tracking for ad events. The SDK now maintains a persistent, device-local sum of all ad values (revenue) generated by the user.
- Every ad event now automatically includes a `total_ad_value` field, representing the total value of all ads viewed by the user since app install.
- The cumulative value is stored using Unity's PlayerPrefs and persists across app sessions and device restarts.
- Updated `SendCustomAdEvent` and new `SendAdViewEvent` APIs to automatically update and include `total_ad_value` in event payloads.
- Added `AudiencelabSDK.GetTotalAdValue()` to retrieve the current cumulative ad value for the user.
- Updated documentation and usage examples to reflect the new API and event data structure.

## [0.9.61] - 2025-05-20
