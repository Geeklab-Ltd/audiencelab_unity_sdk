## [0.99] - 2024-06-07

### Added

- Introduced cumulative `total_ad_value` tracking for ad events. The SDK now maintains a persistent, device-local sum of all ad values (revenue) generated by the user.
- Every ad event now automatically includes a `total_ad_value` field, representing the total value of all ads viewed by the user since app install.
- The cumulative value is stored using Unity's PlayerPrefs and persists across app sessions and device restarts.
- Updated `SendCustomAdEvent` and new `SendAdViewEvent` APIs to automatically update and include `total_ad_value` in event payloads.
- Added `AudiencelabSDK.GetTotalAdValue()` to retrieve the current cumulative ad value for the user.
- Updated documentation and usage examples to reflect the new API and event data structure.
